                This version of Tic Tac Toe plays mechanically like regular Tic Tac Toe.  One player is X and the other is O.
                Turn by turn, each player puts his or her letter into one of the squares on the 3X3 grid.
                If there are 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) that player is the winner.
                Two Layer Tic Tac Toe differs in that players can take spaces away from one another.
                A space can only be locked if you take it twice.
                For example, if you put your X on the center square, the other player can place his or her O on the center square later and take it away from you.
                If you place a second X on the center square before your opponent takes it away, you’ve claimed it for good.
                Because of the layered nature of the game, there are a couple of new rules.
                If there is a letter on the space, whether once or twice, the space is considered held by that player.
                A player can win the game with connected single-layer captures.
                A player may not move on the same space his or her opponent took on the previous turn.
                For example, if I take the center square, you cannot move onto the center square on your very next turn.
                You can only do it on a later turn.
